# Assignment 1
calculating the global minimum point and value for the function f(x,y) = x^4 + 3^x^2 + 10 . (updating only single parameter x).

# Assignment 3
python code to build simple linear regression model using <b>Stochastic </b>Gradient Descent (SGD) optimiser (implemented on a sample data)

# Assignment 4
python code to build simple linear regression model using <b>Stochastic</b> Gradient Descent (SGD) optimiser (implemented on a realtime data set)
<p> this model is used to predict the number of bicarbonates present in a well water by giving pH value of water as input to model.
  <br>input: pH value
  <br> output: number of bicarbonates

# Assignment 5
python code to build simple linear regression model using <b>Mini Batch</b> Gradient Descent (MBGD) optimiser (implemented on a sample data)

# Assignment 7
python code to build simple linear regression model using <b>Batch</b> Gradient Descent (BGD) optimiser (implemented on a sample data)

# Assignment 8
python code to build simple linear regression model using <b>Batch</b> Gradient Descent (BGD) optimiser (implemented on a realtime data set)
<p> this model is used to predict the weight of liquid nitrogen  by giving pressure of liquid nitrogen as input to model.
  <br>input: pressure of liquid nitrogen
  <br> output: weight of liquid nitrogen

# Assignment 9
